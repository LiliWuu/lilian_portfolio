### New Levels Plan
**Plot**: A guy was trying to get home when he got into a car crash and ended up in a coma. Even though the man was under a coma during his hospitalization, his mind was weirdly active. Somehow, he was transported to a alternate world that only existed inside his mind. Initially, he finds himself in a cupcake world with delicious sweets surrounding him. The harmlessness of the world made him want to stay longer, but he knows he has to keep going and escape. As he treks further, he encounters monsters along the way and the world becomes darker and more ominous.
* Make 2 new levels
    * One for the cupcake level and one for the demonic level
*
