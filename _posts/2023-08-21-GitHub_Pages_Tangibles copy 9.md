- [Animated coyotes](https://github.com/kaylale124/final-game/commit/e57ac29ead7de22cb24a475197c11c8de070a78d)
    - [Edited to make wolf in grid shape](https://github.com/kaylale124/final-game/commit/d5106f90fb245e3df62f481250f36d53a260bb96)
## Problems Encountered and Revisions

| Problems  | Solutions  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Had difficulty with coyote animation only showing one coyote and not multiple frames of coyote at the same time | Asked teacher for help, just needed to adjust dimensions  |   |   |
| (Concern)Coyotes as grid means they would be counted for as an entire object, not individual sprites  | Asked ChatGPT to make them individual  |   |   |
