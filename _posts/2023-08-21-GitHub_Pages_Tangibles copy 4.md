## Problems Encountered and Revisions

| Problems  | Solutions  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gitpull was not working and said my branches were diverged and had trouble merging my changes  | Seeked help and used the command "git reset --hard origin/main" to reset git  |   |   |   |
| 4 Function Calculator: The calculator grid was not in its proper format  | Kayla showed me some code that she used and it worked  |   |   |   |
| JS Input: I tried to make it so that each input field would go into a newly generated row, but it interfered with the code  | I decided to move on and focus on local storage |   |   |   |
