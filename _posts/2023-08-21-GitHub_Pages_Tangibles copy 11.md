## Problems and Solutions

| Problems  | Solutions  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Code was not working with mutiple script tags, couldn't figure out collision object | Asked teacher for help; used OOP instead, [got rid of timer for coyote disappearing](https://github.com/kaylale124/final-game/commit/9e760a79a07461aa49d76559cf7e156f8abfe34c)  |   |   |

## Fails
- [Tried to make coyotes disappear by using a timer when they "touch" the bottom](https://github.com/kaylale124/final-game/commit/3690a01c05150ae0677c4945d3235627ae00f8be)
    - Did this to avoid using collision object because it wasn't working 
- ### [Tried to add new rows of coyotes](https://github.com/kaylale124/final-game/commit/c6eb59c22687d2926247e4902882978b3fc55ee0)

<br><br>

## What I Did
- [Adding scoring to code and decrementation](https://github.com/kaylale124/final-game/commit/c3ecf68c6f1179ac1c4bf7c2c2e94d3dbb22576c)
    - Editing CharacterCoyote2.js
- Had teacher help with OOP
    - Created js files with OOP style
    - Created an md file with OOP and our code
    - Collisions with coyote and floor using floorAction
        - ### [Made coyotes spiral and be destroyed](https://github.com/kaylale124/final-game/commit/dd4756340b5c4b0d350bf88003864030021f6814)

<br><br>

## Thoughts for Improvements
- Did not end up integrating every component into one working screen
    - Had projectiles shoot out of chicken on a different screen/file
    - Had start screen on one file
        - Had to refer back to start screen for the game over screen
    - Had the game screen on a different file
        - Without successful collisions between chicken and coyote
        - I was not able to create new coyotes after the initial ones were destroyed
        - Did not go to the gameover screen when we wanted it to
        - Without projectiles
    - Was not able to include boss chicken (but had it in the corner)
- I should've stayed for extra credit D:
- Should be more on track with blogging
    - Keep records of problems and also ChatGPT answers

## Reflection on Entire Project
- Commits were extremely helpful
    - Helped me keep track of my progress each week
    - Could refer back to old code
    - Showed me how much work I put in

### General Learnings
- Learned coding tools like Vscode, Github
- Learned how to use terminal
- Trial and error with ChatGPT
- Got introduced to coding with early projects like snake game, calculators
    - Later learned basics of coding witht the basics test project
        - Learned the difference in code for different languages like Javascript, CSS, HTML
- Learned how to create our own game (basically from scratch)
    -  Learned to use OOP in Final Project
    -  Learned how to make own files and import and export different files
    -  Learned how to animate sprites
    -  Learned how to debug through console
        - Very helpful for solving issues
    -  Learned how to work in a team and communicate (Liveshare, FaceTime, Huddles)
    - Even more trial and error with ChatGPT
    -  Learned that some problems need to consult teacher
        - Consult before a weekly check

### Positive Accomplishments
- Can see projects working as intended (not really for final project though)
- Learned the basics of coding
- Met new people :D

### Tri 2 Learnings
- Being able to more easily code by myself
    - Use less ChatGPT
- Become more familiarized with OOP
- Get better at integrating different files of code together
- Work more efficiently
